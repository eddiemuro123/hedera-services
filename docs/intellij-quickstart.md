# IntelliJ quickstart

**IMPORTANT** The current implementation of Platform has a non-negotiable dependency
on PostgreSQL. Use the included [Docker-based PostgreSQL setup guide](./postgresql-setup-guide.md)
to ensure you have an appropriately configured PostgreSQL instance before continuing.

## Preliminaries

First, open the top-level *pom.xml* in IntelliJ as a new project.  Then 
run `mvn install` in the root:

<p>
    <img src="./top-level-modules.png"/>
</p>

This will both, 
<ol>
  <li>Build the <i>hedera-node/data/apps/HederaNode.jar</i>; and,
  <li>Populate your <i>hedera-node/data/config</i> directory with 
  default versions of the <i>application.properties</i> and 
  <i>api-permission.properties</i> files that are used to bootstrap 
  a new Hedera Services network.
</ol>

## Starting a local three-node network

Now browse to `com.hedera.services.ServicesMain`. Its
`main` method starts a network of Hedera Service nodes by 
calling `com.swirlds.platform.Browser#main`, which is the
entrypoint to bootstrap any Platform apps.

Run `ServicesMain#main` with an IntelliJ configuration whose working 
directory is the _hedera-node/_ directory of your clone of this repo:

<p>
    <img src="./node-configuration.png" height="300" width="450" />
</p>

You will see three black panes appear, similar to:

<p>
    <img src="./node-startup.png" height="150" width="600"/>
</p>

This node's name is "Alice" because of [Line 26](../hedera-node/config.txt#L26)
in the _config.txt_ present in your working directory. (This file determines the 
Browser's startup sequence.) 

Looking closer at _config.txt_, you can see you are running Hedera Services 
(and not some other app) because [Line 12](../hedera-node/config.txt#L12) 
points to the JAR file you just built; and there are three nodes in your 
network because you specified "Bob" and "Carol" as well as "Alice".

In fact Alice, Bob, and Carol are all running on your local machine; and 
communicating via the loopback interface. But each still has a private 
instance of the Platform, and keeps its own state, just as it would in a 
true distributed network.

## Submitting transactions to your local network

The _test-clients/_ directory in this repo contains a large number of 
end-to-end tests that Hedera engineering uses to validate the behavior of 
Hedera Services. Many of these tests are written in the style of a BDD 
specification. For example, browse to 
`com.hedera.services.bdd.suites.crypto.HelloWorldSpec`, which makes some minimal
assertions about the effects of a crypto transfer.

Run `HelloWorldSpec#main` with an IntelliJ configuration whose working 
directory is the _test-clients/_ directory of your clone of this repo:

<p>
    <img src="./spec-configuration.png" height="300" width="450" />
</p>

Because [`node=localhost`](../test-clients/src/main/resource/spec-default.properties)
in the _spec-default.properties_ controlling the `HelloWorldSpec` test, this
will run against your local network, culminating in logs similar to:

```

``` 

### Helpful Maven goals
 The app writes a significant amount of audit and configuration data to the
local filesystem. This will, at best, lead to a noticeable amount of clutter 
over time; and, at worst, cause inconsistencies with the PostgreSQL state.  
Use the Maven `antrun:run@app-clean` goal in the `hedera-node` project
to delete the files generated by running local networks and tests.
