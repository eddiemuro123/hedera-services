# The Entity Auto Renewal feature

## Goal
-	Allow Hedera Services to automatically search for entities such as accounts, files, smart contracts, topics, tokens... that are about to expire and renew them.

## Design
- Introduce new settings in `application.properties`:
  * `autorenew.isEnabled`
  * `autorenew.numberOfEntitiesToCheck`
  * `autorenew.maxNumberOfEntitiesToRenew`
  * `autorenew.gracePeriod`
- Each Hedera entity has an `expirationTime` which is the effective consensus timestamp at (and after) which the entity is set to expire.
- Each Hedera entity also has an `autoRenewAccount` which is the account to pay for the fees at renewal. If this `autoRenewAccount` is not specified, a crypto account or a smart contract will be responsible for its own renewal fees, while an entity of other types will be marked for deletion at the point of renewal.
- When a Hedera entity is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars (as a rental fee) for the entity to stay active in the ledger state until consensus time passes its `expirationTime`. At its expiration time, Hedera Services will try to extend an entity's expiration time by another `autoRenewPeriod` if the `autoRenewAccount` has enough balance to do so, or as much extension as the remaining balance permits.
- A Hedera entity that lacks a funded `autoRenewAccount`, namely `autoRenewAccount` is not specified or has zero balance at the time renewal fees are due, will be marked for deletion. The entity will then have a grace period (defaulted to 7 days) before permanent deletion.
- A Hedera entity can have its expiration time extended by anyone, not just by the admin account. The expiration time is the only field that can be changed in an update without being signed by the owner or the admin.
- Every token type has an associated account as its treasury account. An expired account on permanent deletion (not being renewed after the grace period) will have its tokens transfer to the treasury account. The treasury account always has an expiration time the same as or later than its token type, because extending the latter automatically extends the former, if needed. So the treasury account canâ€™t expire unless the token type itself expires, in which case, all tokens of that type expire.
- After handling a transaction, Hedera Services will search within the next `autorenew.numberOfEntitiesToCheck` for upto `autorenew.maxNumberOfEntitiesToRenew` entities that expired then try to renew these entities.

## Implementation
Hedera Services will perform a circular scanning of entities, meaning after we reach the last entity in the system, we will go back scanning from the first entity in the system.

When trying to renew an entity:
1. Calculate the fee to extend the entity's `expirationTime` for another `autoRenewPeriod`.
2. If the `autoRenewAccount` of the entity has enough balance to cover this fee:
  - extend the entity's `expirationTime` for another `autoRenewPeriod`.
  - otherwise, translate the remaining balance of the `autoRenewAccount` into an extension, preferably proportional to the fee calculated in step 1, then extend accordingly.
3. If the grace period also passes, delete the entity from the system.

For restart and reconnect: The last scanned entity must be in the state for synchronization.

## Autorenewal record
After autorenewing an entity, Hedera Services will generate a `TransactionRecord` that serves as an autorenewal record and contains the following:

| Field | Type | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| receipt | TransactionReceipt | | receipt will contain either an accountID, a fileID, a contractID, a topicID or a tokenID that got autorenewed |
| transactionHash | bytes | | empty |
| consensusTimestamp | Timestamp | | The consensus timestamp of the autorenewal |
| transactionID | TransactionID | | { empty transactionValidStart, autoRenewAccount } |
| memo | string | | "Entity {ID} was automatically renewed. New expiry: {newExpiry}" |
| transactionFee | uint64 | | The fee charged for the autorenewal of the entity |
| contractCallResult | ContractFunctionResult | | empty |
| contractCreateResult | ContractFunctionResult | | empty |
| transferList | TransferList | | {(autoRenewAccount, -transactionFee), (defaultFeeCollectionAccount, transactionFee)} |
| tokenTransferLists | TokenTransferList | repeated | empty |
| scheduleRef | ScheduleID | | empty |

The main difference between an autorenewal record and a regular `TransactionRecord` is that it has an empty `transactionHash` and an empty `transactionID.transactionValidStart`. There were older versions of Hedera Services that did not have `transactionHash` in a `TransactionRecord`, but an empty `transactionID.transactionValidStart` will guarantee that the `TransactionRecord` was generated in place of an autorenewal record.

## Entity removal record
After autodeleting an entity due to the zero balance of the `autoRenewAccount`, Hedera Services will generate a `TransactionRecord` that serves as an autodeletion record and contains the following:

| Field | Type | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| receipt | TransactionReceipt | | receipt will contain either an accountID, a fileID, a contractID, a topicID or a tokenID that got autodeleted |
| transactionHash | bytes | | empty |
| consensusTimestamp | Timestamp | | The consensus timestamp of the autodeletion |
| transactionID | TransactionID | | { empty transactionValidStart, autoRenewAccount } |
| memo | string | | "Entity {ID} was automatically deleted." |
| transactionFee | uint64 | | 0 |
| contractCallResult | ContractFunctionResult | | empty |
| contractCreateResult | ContractFunctionResult | | empty |
| transferList | TransferList | | empty |
| tokenTransferLists | TokenTransferList | repeated | empty |
| scheduleRef | ScheduleID | | empty |

An autodeletion record will be very similar to an autorenewal record. The `memo` will reflect that the entity was automatically deleted. Due to the zero balance of the `autoRenewAccount`, the `transactionFee` is zero and the `transferList` is empty.

## Special notes
- At the time of this writing, a file is not associated with an `autoRenewAccount` so a file can only be renewed by a fileUpdate transaction.
- Because cryptoDelete transfers all remaining balance of an account to another account, all accounts that are marked `deleted` will have zero balance. In other words, an account with a non-zero balance will never be marked `deleted`. Step 2 of the implementation does not need to worry about the `autoRenewAccount` being marked `deleted` before.
- At the time of this writing, __only topics__ have an AUTORENEW_GRACE_PERIOD of 7 days being mentioned in the HAPI document. Propose to either __remove__ this grace period or introduce `autorenew.gracePeriod` in `application.properties` to specify the autorenew grace period for __all entities__.
