/*
Create a new token. After the token is created, the Token ID for it is in the receipt.
The Name and Symbol properties must be unique within the network. If there are other tokens defined with the same name or symbol, respectively TOKEN_SYMBOL_ALREADY_IN_USE and TOKEN_NAME_ALREADY_IN_USE errors are returned.
The specified Treasury Account is receiving the initial supply of tokens as-well as the tokens from the Token Mint operation once executed. The balance of the treasury account is decreased when the Token Burn operation is executed.

The supply that is going to be put in circulation is going to be S*(10^D), where S is initial supply and D is decimals. The maximum supply a token can have is S*(10^D) < 2^63.

Creating immutable token: Token can be created as immutable if the adminKey is omitted. In this case, the name, symbol, treasury, management keys, expiry and renew properties cannot be updated. If a token is created as immutable, anyone is able to extend the expiry time by paying the fee.
